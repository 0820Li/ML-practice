Hi, I upload them online so that employers can check my work. 

They are basically my machine learning assignments and practices including my Kaggle file(s)

A1: Homo and Non-homo Ordinary Least Squares(OLS), and Regularized Least Squares(RLS)

A2: Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA on labeled faces in the wild and two noisy circles datasets.

A3: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression with PyTorch implementation, linear SVM for MINIST classification, non linearity and data augmentation

A4: Neural Network for image processing on SVHN dataset(Classification and Denoising)

Kaggle_CIFAR_CNN: kaggle CIFAR Classification challenge, CNN implementation
